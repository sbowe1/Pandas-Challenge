    "## Conclusions\n",
    "The most startling difference in test scores (math and overall) occurs between Charter and District type schools. While their average math and reading scores both differ by less than 10 points, there is a large discrepancy between the percentage of students who pass math and pass overall between the two school types. Overall, just above half (53.67%) of the students at a District school pass both math and reading, contrasting the 90.43% who pass at a Charter school. \n",
    "\n",
    "There also appears to be a correlation between school size and a decreasing overall passing rate, however the correlation is not linear. Both small schools (less than 1000 students) and medium schools (1000-2000 students) have around a 90% overall passing rate - 89.88% and 90.62%, respectively. As the school size increases to over 2000, the overall passing rate drops to 58.29%. Fewer resources available to a large school density can be attributed to this drop. This trend is depicted in the Bottom Performing Schools table, which shows that the bottom 5 performing schools all have greater than 2000 students. "
